# customer-classification


In this project, we used various algorithms like k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, discriminant analysis, etc. to perform customer segmentation of a financial institution. The desired outcome is to have a reliable and fast classifier to support decision-makers in conceding (or not) a line of credit to future credit card holders according to their profile. The metadata has been changed to meaningless symbols to protect the confidentiality and all programming was done in MATLAB.
